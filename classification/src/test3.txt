Mech Overdrive: Advanced Upgrade Modules
*"When your Centipedes canâ€™t haul enough shells for 10-wave raids, you build better war machines."*

Add 14 new implantable upgrades to transform your mechanoids into hyper-specialized workhorses or battlefield terrors. Perfect for colonies drowning in late-game raids or industrial overhauls!

Key Features
Four Specialization Paths: Load Capacity | Mobility | Cooling | Core Output

Stackable Upgrades: Compact designs allow multiple implants (at ruinous material costs)

CE/Biotech Compatible: Integrates with Combat Extended, Biotech, and Additional Upgrades

Brutal Tradeoffs: Every enhancement comes with calculated downsides (toxic waste, energy drain, mobility loss)

Design Notes
Anti-Cheese: High-tier upgrades demand late-game resources (Plasteel/Hyperweave sinks)

Synergy Focus: Combine Cooling + Power Cells to mitigate downsides

CE Meta: Load systems respect CarryWeight scaling; Optics boost CE accuracy

*"Tested in 500-day megacolonies â€“ your mechanoids will finally feel like $50,000 silver war machines."*
